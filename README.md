# get_my_deck
Thanks to https://github.com/maroofc and https://github.com/pravinthan or their original codebase!<br>

*A simple scraper which checks the Steam Deck Refurb page for stock (512gb) since there doesn't seem to be any for refurbs out there and definitely no official way of doing this.
Other options for webscrapers were paid.*<br>


## Requirements:
Python<br>
Selenium (pip install selenium)<br>
Chrome Drivers for Python (pip install webdriver_manager) OR local install of Google Chrome browser<br>
Tkinter (pip install tkinter)<br>


## To Run:
Open the folder directory in Terminal/Command Prompt and run "python get_my_deck.py"
